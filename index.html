	                     <p align="justify"> Wireless sensing has recently attracted a lot of attention thanks to its non-intrusive 
				     and sensor-free nature. Contrary to the traditional sensor-based and wearable sensing, wireless sensing does not
				     need any sensors but leverages the signal distortions and machine learning algorithms for sensing. 
				     Moreover, wireless signals can propagate through walls which allows sensing to be performed even in non-line-of 
				     sight (NLOS) scenarios which increases the sensing coverage over camera-based systems. 
				     Different types of wireless signals have been employed for sensing including WiFi, RFID, mmWave, UWB, 
				     and acoustic signals. As wireless signals bounce off of physical objects within the environment such as 
				     static objects like walls or furniture as well as any humans in the environment, their characteristics 
				     (e.g., amplitude, phase) change uniquely. This then provides an opportunity to 
				     sense the environment and obtain contextual information (e.g., recognizing the motion) 
				     through a fine-grained analysis of signal variations. 
				     Wireless sensing has been considered in various applications including but not limited to localization, 
				     human activity and gesture recognition, gait estimation, fall detection, respiration monitoring and 
				     crowd counting.</p>
				  
			<p align="justify"> Deploying the wireless sensing systems on edge devices is also important, to reduce their costs and make them scalable. 
				However, this comes with several challenges due to the constrained resources (e.g., memory, computation power, energy) of edge nodes. 
				Accordingly, in this workshop we also look for solutions that develop novel, lightweight and cost-efficient techniques that can run at the network edge, providing means
				to train and run machine learning models in an energy efficient manner, both according to centralized and distributed training paradigms. 
				We are also interested in the characterization of energetic aspects on currently available edge computing technology, including but not limited to empirical energy models.</p>

<i>ABSTRACT</i></p>

<p>

With more and more bandwidth readily available for the next generation of wireless applications, many intelligent products/services by leveraging the ambient radio waves unimaginable before are now possible. What impact will it bring to our lives? Many may wonder or even speculate if it is science fiction or real? In this talk, we will show that with more bandwidth, one can see many multi-paths, which can serve as hundreds of virtual sensors around us that can be readily leveraged as new degrees of freedom readily for our use (but we never realized that before!). We discovered for the first time that the time-reversal focusing spot is not a point but exhibiting a stationary power distribution of Bessel function which enabled accurate/reliable speed estimation under non-line-of-sight, severe multipath conditions, uncovering a new physical principle ideal for indoor applications. Together with the use of machine learning, a revolutionary wireless AI platform can be built to enable many IoT applications that have been dreamed for a long time but have never been possibly achieved. </p>
 
<p>
Such a technology forms the core of a wireless sensing AI platform that can be applied to many device-free, non-obtrusive applications. We will show the world’s first ever centimeter-accuracy wireless indoor positioning systems that can offer indoor tracking without any costly infrastructure, home/office monitoring and security, radio human biometrics, vital signs detection, sleep monitoring, gait recognition, and fall detection, without any wearable but sorely relying on ubiquitous commodity Wi-Fi. In essence, now and in the future, it is the wireless sensing that will forever change Wi-Fi as we know it today, as well as future 5G/6G systems, allowing us to decipher our surrounding world with a new “sixth sense”. Some products/services of Origin have been deployed worldwide and will be demonstrated to illustrate how such a fundamental discovery can make the world a better place.
